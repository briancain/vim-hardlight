# vim-hardlight

A hardlight syntax highlighting plugin for vim. This plugin will be a work in
progress as the Hardlight programming language is developed. Some pieces of the
language don't look right yet but this is a good first pass!

## Installation

If you are using a plugin manager like vundle, you should be able to reference
the plugin like others:

```vim
Bundle 'briancain/vim-hardlight'
```

And then `:BundleInstall` to get vim to install the plugin.

For manual installation, clone this repo and place the project folder in your
configured Vim plugin directory.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:briancain/vim-hardlight.git ~/.vim/<plugin_manager>/vim-hardlight
```

Then specify the plugin in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
Plugin "vim-hardlight"
```
